# 🏠 Full-Stack House Price Predictor

A **Full-Stack Machine Learning Application** built to predict house prices in India using modern technologies.

This project demonstrates how to integrate:
- 🧮 **scikit-learn** → for training the Linear Regression model  
- ⚙️ **FastAPI** → for serving predictions via a REST API  
- 🖥️ **Streamlit** → for creating an interactive frontend web UI

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

Follow these steps **in order** in your terminal 👇  

---

### 🧩 Step 0: Initial Setup

#### 1️⃣ Create a Project Directory
```bash
mkdir house-price-predictor
cd house-price-predictor
```

#### 2️⃣ Save All Files
Save all these files into your project folder:  
`app.py`, `main.py`, `train.py`, `mock_housing_data.csv`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md`

#### 3️⃣ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 4️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🧠 Step 1: Train the Model

Run the training script to build and save your regression model:
```bash
python train.py
```

**✅ Expected Output:**
```
Starting model training...
Loaded 12 rows of data.
Model training complete. Test RMSE: 18.06
Model pipeline saved to 'housing_model.joblib'
```

---

### 🚀 Step 2: Run the FastAPI Server

Start the backend API server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**✅ Expected Output:**
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Model 'housing_model.joblib' loaded successfully.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

> ⚠️ Keep this terminal open — it’s your running FastAPI backend.

---

### 💻 Step 3: Run the Streamlit Frontend

Open a **new terminal** (keep the FastAPI one running) and run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**✅ Expected Output:**
```
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://...
```

---

### 🏡 Step 4: Use the Application

1. Open **http://localhost:8501** in your browser.  
2. Adjust the sliders and dropdowns to input block group features.  
3. Click **Predict Price**.  
4. See your predicted house price instantly — powered by your trained ML model!

## 🧾 Example Flow

🧩 **Streamlit (Frontend)** → User inputs house details  
⚙️ **FastAPI (Backend)** → Receives data and calls ML model  
🧮 **scikit-learn Model** → Predicts house price  
📊 **Streamlit UI** → Displays prediction dynamically

## 📦 Tech Stack

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| 🐍 **Python** | Core programming language |
| 🧮 **scikit-learn** | Linear Regression model |
| ⚙️ **FastAPI** | Backend REST API |
| 🖥️ **Streamlit** | Interactive frontend |
| 💾 **joblib** | Model serialization |
| 📊 **pandas / numpy** | Data handling and preprocessing |

---

## 🌟 Features

✅ Real-time prediction through FastAPI  
✅ Interactive sliders for user input  
✅ End-to-end ML workflow (train → serve → predict)  
✅ Modular structure for easy updates  
✅ Works entirely locally (no cloud required)  

---

## 🏁 Final Notes

- Ensure both **FastAPI** and **Streamlit** servers are running simultaneously.  
- Re-run `train.py` whenever you update your dataset.  
- You can replace `mock_housing_data.csv` with a real housing dataset for better accuracy.
